I can be opinionated, and have opinions about findings just outside my own field. This can dangerous, because when you feel you have the expertise to speak, but don’t really, that’s when you are at risk of exerting a negative influence on the world, you’ll sound convincing because you know things, you might be wrong because you don’t know all the things! Ill try to not let that happen here. What I do what to do here is discuss papers, or series of papers by others I think are worthwhile or important. My goal is to highlight convincing science but also to point out limitations and opportunities for follow up.\n\n\n\n",
